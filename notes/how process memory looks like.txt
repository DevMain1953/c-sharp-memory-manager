Method call:
sum = calculatorObject.getSumOfTwoNumbers(first_number, second_number);

Method call in assembly language:
push second_number to stack
push first_number to stack
push calculatorObject to stack
call getSumOfTwoNumbers

register of processor = method result
sum = register of processor

What memory addresses can store:
address = simple parameter (health, ammo in games)
address (pointer) = other address
address = bytes of instruction in assembly language (mov eax, 5)

==============================================================================

class in OOP == structure in low level programming;

address of target field in structure = address of structure object + offset to target field in bytes;
value from target field of structure = get value from (address of target field in structure);
simple_structure {
  first_field = simple_structure + 0x1;
  second_field = simple_structure + 0x2;
  ...
  last_field = simple_structure + 0x50;
};
